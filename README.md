# 🌍 Real-Time Multi-Currency Converter Using Java

A **real-time, console-based multi-currency converter** built using **Java**, following **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)** principles and **REST API integration**.  
This application dynamically fetches **live exchange rates** and supports conversion between **multiple global currencies**.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a **real-world Java application** that consumes a **live REST API** to perform currency conversion.  
The design follows clean coding practices by separating **data models**, **business logic**, and **API handling** into different classes.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

- To convert one currency into another using **real-time exchange rates**
- To apply **OOPS principles** in a practical Java project
- To understand **REST API consumption** using Java’s built-in HTTP client
- To handle runtime errors gracefully using **exception handling**
